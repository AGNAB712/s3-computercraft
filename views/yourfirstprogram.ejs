    <h1>Your first program</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to computercraft!</h2>
    <p>Thank you for choosing to play through this questline. I spent a long time on it and I'm proud of how it's come out. By the end of this you will become an ultimate computercraft MASTER.</p>
    <p>To start, we need to understand the terminal.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Terminal commands</h3>
    <p>The most used terminal command that you'll use is likely <strong>edit (filename)</strong>, which is used to create new files and edit existing ones. This isn't the only terminal command, there are some other useful ones as well.</p>
    <p><strong>- lua: </strong> turns the terminal into a place to write individual lua code, great if you want to test something but dont want to make a new file</p>
    <p><strong>- label set: </strong> labels your computer, you can also use colored/bolded/italicized text by using the symbol "ยง" like how you used to on signs</p>
    <p><strong>- pastebin get/put: </strong> lets you store and retrieve your programs on pastebin.com! I reccomend looking at the link at the bottom if you want to learn more.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Creating your first file</h2>
    <p>To create your first file, type in <strong>edit (filename)</strong> to the terminal. This will open a new window which is where you will edit the file.</p>
    <p>For your first file, you can copy in the code below:</p>
    <pre><img src="/img/copy.png" id="lua-copy-image" alt="Copy text" onclick="copyText()"><code class="language-lua" id="toCopy">print("Hello world!")</code></pre>
    <p>This will print out text saying "Hello world!" to the output shell when it is run</p>
    <p>To run your program, press CTRL or click on the bottom part to open the menu. Press "Save", and then press "Run", and your code should run!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Since your code only runs once through, you can click any button to return to the code editor. If your code runs in a loop and doesn't end, you can press CTRL+T to terminate the currently running program.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Congrats! You have just run your first program in ComputerCraft!</strong></p>
