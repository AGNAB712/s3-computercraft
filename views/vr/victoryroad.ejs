    <h1>Victory road</h1>
    <article>
      <p>Congratulations on making it here! This means that you're a true CC master.</p>
      <p>Now that you've done everything for computercraft, maybe that means that you're ready to move on to <strong>outside of minecraft...</strong></p>
      <h2>What is the objective of victory road?</h2>
      <p>The objective of this quest is to create your <strong>own web server</strong>. In order to complete this quest, your web server must be able to take information from cc computers, and give new information back. Bonus points if it's something you can't do in cc already (like converting audio to dfpwm or converting an image link to a cc image, or interacting with some other npm library)</p>
      <h2>How do I complete this quest?</h2>
      <p>Unlike most CC quests, this quest is not a checkmark quest. Your web server with have to be seen/used by an admin, who will grant you the quest upon completion.</p>
      <br>
      <div class="tip">
        <h3>NOTE:</h3>
        <p>Sadly, in order to completely understand what is going on behind the scenes, you will need <strong>some knowledge of Javascript</strong>. Knowing it is not neccessary to complete this, but you will understand it a lot better if you understand the basic syntax (it's really not too hard if you know this much lua already)</p>
        <p>The website I would reccomend for learning basic JS syntax is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_syntax.asp" target="_blank" style="
